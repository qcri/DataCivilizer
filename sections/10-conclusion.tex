\section{Conclusion and Future Work}
\label{sec:conclusion}

In this paper, we propose an end-to-end big data management system named \dcv with the goal of discovering relevant data to the user specific tasks, link the relevant data for better usage, cleaning the data with limit budget, handle data updates, and enable iteratively processing the data. We build a module for each of the requirement above. As data in large companies are usually across multiple data storage platforms, we build our system in a polystore architecture. Moreover, we propose to place the data cleaning operation in the query plan, and trade-off the query result quality with the cleaning costs. We deployed our preliminary system on two different institutions, MIT and Merck and got positive feedbacks from the users.
