\section{Tractable Curation Workflow}
\label{sec:workflow}

The process of data curation on demand might entail various iterations of data discovery, data stitching, and data curation steps. Especially the data curation requirement might consist of various cleaning and transformation procedures that have to be guided by a user. To facilitate the user in this is process, we exploit the fact that the type of data curation and preparation needed inside a company might follow repretitive patterns. 
Therefore, 
we will store the sequence of data curation operations in a workflow registry together with the meta-data and signatures provided by the data discovery component for comparison with future data discovery scenarios. 

During later data discovery tasks, the signatures will be compared to those stored in the workflow registry and accordingly the related curation and preparation procedures will be proposed to the user. Furthermore, the workflow registry will be able to identify redundant and subsuming curation steps by profiling the input and output of each operation.
