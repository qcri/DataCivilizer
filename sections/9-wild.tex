\section{Data Civilizer in the Wild}
\label{sec:wild}

We have deployed a preliminary prototype of Data Civilizer in two different
organizations. The MIT Datawarehouse is a group inside MIT responsible for
building and maintaining a data warehouse that integrates data from multiple
source systems. Merck, a big pharmaceutical company, manages large volumes of
data, which are managed by different storage systems. Some characteristics of
both organizations' data are shown in Table~\ref{tab:dataCivInTheWild}. Next we
provide detail on each organizations' requirements, and how we are using Data
Civilizer to help them.

\subsection{MIT Data warehouse}

The MIT Datawarehouse is a team within MIT that manages a warehouse that
integrates data from hundreds of source databases from around the campus. One of
the key tasks of the team is to assist its customers---any personnel from within
MIT---in answering questions they have, for example, to create reports. The
warehouse contains around 1TB of data spread across 3K tables aproximately.

A typical customer of the warehouse will present a question, for whith the
members will need to find relevant tables manually. They create a view that is
accessed by the customer to solve the question at hand. We describe next some of
the common use cases we have found:

\mypar{Fill in virtual schema} When a customer arrives with a question such as:
\emph{I need to create a report with the \textbf{gender distribution of the faculty per
department and year}}, the data warehouse personnel can use Data Civilizer to
find all the tables that contain schema names similar to the attributes exposed
by the query, \eg gender, faculty name, department, year. 

\mypar{Table redundancy} Multiple views are created for different customers.
Many of them contain typically very similar data, as multiple customers are
interested in similar items. To reduce the redundancy of data, Data Civilizer
helps to detect complementary as well as repeated sources. This sheds light on
the status of the warehouse and helps to maintain it tidy and minimal.

We deployed Data Civilizer as a \ldots service and allowed the users to interact
with the system through the graphical interface. Data Civilizer was able to
\ldots

\subsection{Merck}

Merck is a big pharmaceutical company that manages large volumes of data spread
across around 4K databases, plus several data lakes. The use cases are varied,
however there is a common case. One of the data assets of any pharmaceutical
company are internal databases of chemical compounds and structures. Usually,
these are more valuable when integrated with external, well-known and curated
databases, such as PubChem \cite{pubchem}, Chembl \cite{chembl} or Drugbank
\cite{drugbank}. We describe two common use cases that occur in this context:

\mypar{Identify entities} One single chemical entity may be referred to with
different identifier format in different databases. Chemical identifiers have
been a subject of research in the bioinformatics community: multiple different
formats have been proposed with different properties desirable according to the
scenario. Data Civilizer helps by mapping the multiple representations of the
identifiers, therefore facilitating the identification of entities across
multiple databases, public and internal.

\mypar{Enrich data} One of the reasons for the existence of multiple chemical
databases is that each puts an emphasis on different information. Analysts
typically face situations in which they are interested in a set of attributes
that are spread across different tables on different databases. Data Civilizer
helps to detect such attributes and bring them together \emph{on-demand} to
serve the users' purpose.
