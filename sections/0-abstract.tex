\begin{abstract}
In many organizations, it is often challenging for users to find relevant data for  specific tasks, since the data is often scattered across the enterprise and often inconsistent. In fact, data scientists routinely report that the majority of their effort is spent finding, cleaning, integrating, and accessing data of interest to a task at hand. In order to decrease the ``grunt work'' needed to facilitate the analysis of data ``in the wild'', we present \dcv, an end-to-end data management system. \dcv has a {\em data discovery} module to help identify data that is relevant to user tasks. It also contains a {\em linkage graph computation} module that links discovered data, so it can be queried, along with a polystore DBMS for query execution, which also integrates data cleaning operations.

In practice, different tasks might invoke the above modules in different orders, and might be iterative. To cope with this, the system has a {\em workflow} engine to enable the arbitrary composition of different modules, as well as to handle data updates. We have deployed our preliminary \dcv system in two institutions, MIT and Merck. Users have given us positive feedback and indicated that the system indeed shortened their time and effort to find, prepare, and analyze the data.
