In this paper, we present an end-to-end data management system, named \dcv, whose main purpose is to decrease the 
``grunt work''\mourad{I prefer http://dictionary.cambridge.org/dictionary/english/grunt-work.} needed to facilitate the 
%``mung work''  for  analyzing
analysis of data in the wild. 
In large companies, it is usually hard for users to find the relevant data for their specific tasks, the data are often scattered everywhere, inconsistent, and updated frequently. To solve these problems, \dcv has a data discovery module to help users identify their interesting data. 
We also develop a data stitching module to link all the relevant data for a better usage. 
We build the system on top of a polystore architecture and integrate the data cleaning operations in the query plan. 
In addition, as the data preprocessing conducted by the users are often repetitive, we design a workflow engine to enable the composition and the iteration over the above modules as well the handling of updates. We deployed our preliminary \dcv system on two institutions, MIT and Merck. The users gave us positive feedbacks and indicated that the system indeed shortened their time and effort to prepare and analyze the data.
